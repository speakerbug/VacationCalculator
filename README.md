This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose

This was originally created to give me a small example to create my first React app. It's used to calculate how many vacation days someone has left. It was designed specifically for the [Museum of Science, Boston](https://www.mos.org), but in theory could apply to any job position.

## Making Changes

Clone the repo and run `npm start`.
This will run the app in development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Deploying

This is currently hosted on GitHub Pages. Run `npm run deploy`. This will create a production build and create a commit to the gh-pages branch in this repo. I used [this](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages/) tutorial to walk through how to set this up.
